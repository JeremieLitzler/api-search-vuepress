# API to search contents on a VuePress 2 website

The package is using the ECMAScript module system. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/57492606 and `package.json` > `type`.

## Getting started

Run:

```sh
npm install
#then...
npm run serve
```

## How to host

I use Cloudways and the Cloud Keeper has written an article about that: [see it here](https://www.thecloudkeeper.io/how-to-host-a-nodejs-app-on-cloudways/).
