# API to search contents on a VuePress 2 website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/472c276c-aaf2-4840-ac50-9f2bf8d39975/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/api-search-vuepress/deploys)

The package is using the ECMAScript module system. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/57492606 and `package.json` > `type`.

## Getting started

Run:

```sh
npm install
#then...
npm run serve
```

## How to host

I use Cloudways and the Cloud Keeper has written an article about that: [see it here](https://www.thecloudkeeper.io/how-to-host-a-nodejs-app-on-cloudways/).
